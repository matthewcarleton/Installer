# Introduction
## Summary

The purpose of this screen is to offer language selection but also to clarify what the installer will do. The text should describe the process of the system scan and the following steps. The new installer aims to help the user navigate through the process without making any assumptions as to what they would prefer to adjust.

### Things to still be considered
- Subscription management
- option to add a kickstart type script to preset software selection etc.
