# Installer for RHEL 8
## Goals
As the RHEL ecosystem grows and Red Hat has initiatives to present a portfolio of products to customers, it is even more important to ensure end users have a consistent experience across that portfolio.
Some ways to achieve this goal:
- Ensure all Red Hat branded products have a similar look and feel
- Similar functionality behaves in the same way across Red Hat branded products

The purpose of theses docs is to provide an up to date record of the current design while also providing a history of where the design was.
