# Login
This page offers the user to connect to their account early on in the process.

### Process
The user can choose from a few different options, or they can skip this entirely. If they do enter a username/password the "skip" button changes to login (second screen below).

### Things to consider
- There is a kickstart option
- There is a satellite option
- Language needs to be written around how to register.
- Do we have content around privacy policy and terms of service?
